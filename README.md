# Recursion
## Aim:-
        Perform Recursion
### Theory:-
            Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way. In programming languages, if a program allows you to call a             function inside the same function, then it is called a recursive call of the function.
#### Algorithm:-
##### Conclusion:-
                From this program we learnt what a recursive function is and how to implement it for doing different types of functions and                 processes
